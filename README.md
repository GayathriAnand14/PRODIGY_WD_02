# TASK 2-STOPWATCH WEB APPLICAION

In this task, I developed a **Stopwatch Web Application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a responsive and user-friendly stopwatch interface that allows users to track time intervals with the ability to start, pause, and reset the timer.

## Tools & Technologies Used:

- HTML: To structure the web page elements (heading, timer display, and buttons).

- CSS: To style the user interface and layout for a better visual appearance.

- JavaScript: To implement core stopwatch functionalities such as time tracking, pause, and reset.

## Features:

- Clean and simple stopwatch UI.

- Start button to begin the timer.

- Pause button to halt the timer temporarily.

- Reset button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.

- Real-time time tracking and smooth transitions.

## What I Learned:

- How to dynamically update time using setInterval() in JavaScript.

- DOM manipulation to interact with elements on the page.

- Managing and clearing intervals in JavaScript.

- Styling layout using CSS Flexbox and classes.
